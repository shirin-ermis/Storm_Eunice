grib_set error: no value provided for key "dataDate"

NAME 	grib_set

DESCRIPTION
	Sets key/value pairs in the input GRIB file and writes
	each message to the output_grib_file.
	It fails when an error occurs (e.g. key not found).

USAGE 
	grib_set [options] grib_file grib_file ... output_grib_file

OPTIONS
	-s key[:{s|d|i}]=value,key[:{s|d|i}]=value,...	
		Key/values to set.
		For each key a string (key:s), a double (key:d) or an integer (key:i)
		type can be defined. By default the native type is set.
	-r 	Repack data. Sometimes after setting some keys involving properties
		of the packing algorithm a repacking of data is needed.
		This repacking is performed setting this -r option.
	-d value	
		Set all the data values to "value".
	-p key[:{s|d|i}],key[:{s|d|i}],...	
		Declaration of keys to print.
		For each key a string (key:s), a double (key:d) or an integer (key:i)
		type can be requested. Default type is string.
	-P key[:{s|d|i}],key[:{s|d|i}],...	
		As -p adding the declared keys to the default list.
	-w key[:{s|d|i}]{=|!=}value,key[:{s|d|i}]=value,...	
		Where clause.
		Set is only executed for GRIB messages matching all the key/value constraints.
		If a GRIB message does not match the constraints it is copied unchanged
		to the output_grib_file. This behaviour can be changed setting the option -S.
		A valid constraint is of type key=value or key!=value.
		For each key a string (key:s), a double (key:d) or an integer (key:i)
		type can be defined. Default type is string.
		In the value you can also use the forward-slash character '/' to specify an OR condition (i.e. a logical disjunction)
		Note: only one -w clause is allowed.
	-7 	Does not fail when the message has wrong length
	-S 	Strict. Only messages matching all the constraints are copied to
		the output file
	-V 	Version.
	-M 	Multi-field support off. Turn off support for multiple fields in single GRIB message.
	-g 	Copy GTS header. 
	-G 	GRIBEX compatibility mode.
	-T T | B | M | A	Message type. T->GTS, B->BUFR, M->METAR (Experimental), A->Any (Experimental).
				The input file is interpreted according to the message type.
	-f 	Force. Force the execution not to fail on error.
	-v 	Verbose.
